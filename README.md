# GitPower
A Powershell script that will jump into every directory at a given location and run "git fetch" and "git pull" in every directory.

Future Plans:
As of creating this, I realized the limitations of PowerShell on windows as a lot of its functionality is stunted by the ExecutionPolicy. With this in mind, I plan on releasing a GoLang version called GitGo. I have a lot of things planned for this version as GoLang works great with concurrency. Programming on this new version will start soon but might take a little longer than this one as I'll be learning Go from scratch. After the release, this version will become deprecated and the GitGo will take its place.

Remains public to show process.
