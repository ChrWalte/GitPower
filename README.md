# GitPower
Powershell script that goes into every directory of a given location and runs "git fetch" and "git pull"!

Future Plans:
As of creating this, I realized the limitations of PowerShell on windows as a lot of its functionality is stunted by the ExecutionPolicy. With this in mind, I plan on releasing a GoLang version called GitGo. I have a lot of things planned for this version as GoLang works great with concurrency. Programming on this new version will start soon but might take a little longer than this one as I'll be learning Go from scratch. After the release, this version will become deprecated and the GitGo will take its place.
